          Do you have a passion for social impact? If yes, Socious Inc. is looking for somebody with your enthusiasm and skills to work as part of the team. We are looking for a growth expert who is curious, driven, and passionate about social and environmental impact. If you are looking for a role where you can make a major impact in the world, we want to meet you.
          <br /><br />
          Socious is a community app for social change, powered by AI and blockchain. Many people are interested in contributing to social impact projects, but few of them can do so. We leverage
          this untapped potential by helping them contribute to society in an easy, fun way through AI recommendations, impact visualization, and rewards in crypto tokens.
          <br /><br />
          We started Socious in July 2021 and are supported by 500 Startups and Microsoft for Startups. As an early employee you’ll be pivotal in shaping the direction of the company.
          <br /><br />
          You’ll be able to work fully remotely from anywhere in the world. If you prefer, we can help you secure a
          working visa.
          <br /><br />
          We communicate in English, and so no Japanese ability is required, though there will be opportunities to use Japanese if
          you’d like to.
          <br /><br />
          In this role, you’ll work closely with senior stakeholders to understand business goals and ensure that the growth
          team & tools used are aligned with these. As we grow, you’ll have the opportuntity to move into a Chief Growth Offier role in the future.
